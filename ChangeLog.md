# Changelog for shake-plus

## v0.0.1.0

* Initial sketch of shake-plus with reexported functions. Mostly oracles,
  filepaths and directory functions using
  [Path](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/path), and `MonadAction`,
  `MonadUnliftAction` and `MonadRules` with `ReaderT` transformers in a similar
  style to [RIO](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rio)
